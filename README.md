# Yuanyuan Zhang (张源远)
Final year PhD candidate at University of Liverpool (UoL) 

I've been pursing my Ph.D. degree in **UoL** since Dec. 2021 following Prof. [Rui Yang](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/RYang), and have a joint background in **signal processing**, **control & optimization** and **deep learning**. I obtained my MSc in Control and Optimization at **Imperial College London** and had great fortune to investigate **Derivative-free Multi-objective Optimization** under the supervision of Prof. [Eric C. Kerrigan](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/e.kerrigan). Prior to that, I received my BEng. degree also from **UoL** in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
